# skittl (a hello wordl clone)

This a clone of `lynn`'s `hello-wordl`, but with a few weird change:

* The first guess is chosen for you at random.
* You must continue to use any green letters that you discover.
* You must continue to find new homes for yellow letters that you discover.
* You may not use any gray letters that you discover.
